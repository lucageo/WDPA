# Digital Observatory for protected Areas

DOPA Explorer 2.0 provides simple means to explore protected areas, identify those with most unique ecosystems and species composition and assess the pressures they are exposed to through human development. DOPA Explorer 2.0 is a web-based assessment tool where information on over 21,000 protected areas (all protected areas â‰¥ 50 km2, covering more than 95% of the global protected surface) has been processed automatically to generate a set of indicators on ecosystems, climate, phenology, species, ecosystem services and pressures. DOPA Explorer 2.0 can help identify the protected areas with most unique ecosystems and the species that have lowest level of protection, and assess the pressures they are exposed to because of human development
